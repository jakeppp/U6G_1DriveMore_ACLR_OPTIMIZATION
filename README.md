# U6G_1DriveMore_ACLR_OPTIMIZATION
To address the performance fluctuation problem in system mass production, we use a trilinear model and a Gaussian process non-parametric model, combined with the quasi-Newton method and gradient descent, to optimize linear consistency by 2-3dB, increase time efficiency by 40 times, and plan to launch N+1 base station product modules.
